# Local Search Algorithm

The Local Search Algorithm is a powerful optimization technique that iteratively explores neighboring solutions within a defined search space to improve the quality of a given solution. This approach is particularly effective for solving complex optimization problems where finding the global optimum might be impractical or too resource-intensive.

## Features

- **Neighborhood Exploration:** The algorithm focuses on exploring nearby solutions, making it well-suited for fine-tuning and local improvements.
- **Constrained Domains:** Ideal for optimization problems with constraints, where global search strategies may struggle.
- **Efficient Refinement:** Iterative nature allows for efficient utilization of resources in refining solutions.
- **Adaptability:** The algorithm can be tailored for specific problems by defining neighborhood structures and exploration strategies.
- **Application Diversity:** Widely applicable in fields like artificial intelligence, operations research, engineering, and more.

## Usage

1. **Define Objective:** Formulate your optimization problem with a well-defined objective function to measure solution quality.

2. **Select Initial Solution:** Choose an initial solution within the search space. This can be random or informed.

3. **Define Neighborhood:** Specify a neighborhood structure that defines how nearby solutions are generated.

4. **Implement Local Search:** Utilize the provided example code or integrate the algorithm into your project.

5. **Explore Neighborhood:** Iteratively explore neighboring solutions, improving the solution by selecting better alternatives.

6. **Termination Criteria:** Decide on a stopping criterion, such as a maximum number of iterations or a specific improvement threshold.

7. **Analyze Results:** Examine the refined solution, considering factors like convergence behavior and solution quality.
